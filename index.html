    <p>Final product of the Arduino robot. Took me about 2 weeks to compete and create the code so it would move like I wanted it to. I decided to build it from scratch using parts and instructions given to me by my mentor Dr. EB. This allowed me to learn more about how the different parts worked together and how a robot such as this functions.</p>
