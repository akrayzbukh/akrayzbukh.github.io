    <p>Under the mentorship of Dr. Eb, I created this autonomous Interactive robot in order to further my knowledge of engineering and how parts came together to create a whole. This robot took me about 2 weeks to complete and was done at home with tools that I had at hand. I then went on to upload the already-created code to the robot. Afterward, after examining the programming language used, I added my own couple of adjustments and in doing so made the robot turn on the command of a button.
