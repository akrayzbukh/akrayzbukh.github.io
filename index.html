    <h3>Autonomous Interactive Robot</h1>
    <img src="/Users/alina/Downloads/IMG_0520.jpg" height="300" width="450" > 
    <p>Under the mentorship of Dr. Eb, I created this autonomous Interactive robot in order to further my knowledge of engineering and how parts came together to create a whole. This robot took me about 2 weeks to complete and was done at home with tools that I had at hand. I then went on to upload the already-created code to the robot. Afterward, after examining the programming language used, I added my own couple of adjustments and in doing so made the robot turn on the command of a button.

    <h3>Alternating Current Generator</h3>

    <p>I am currently working on an Alternating Current Generator. This is a project that I decided to do because I had a sudden interest in learning about how electricity is generated and how wind turbines work after reading about them in an English assignment. This is my first test rectangle to see if I could see if I could fit the magnet into the designated slot. I designed this 3D-printed rectangle by using OpenSCAD.

    <p>After designing the slot for the magnet and calculating the dimensions I continued my work on OpenSCAD and completed the whole circular part.
